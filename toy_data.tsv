Dr. Lisa Roberts, MD, FRCPC Medical Oncologist"1	"ONCOLOGY HISTORY AND CONSULTATION Identification: Patient: Ms. Isabella Morgan Age: 45 years Gender: Female Referring Physician: Dr. Reynolds Diagnosis: Unusual Presentation of Advanced Ovarian Cancer History of Present Illness: Ms. Isabella Morgan, a 45-year-old female, presented with a complex and unusual medical history. She had been experiencing vague abdominal discomfort, bloating, and intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms for several years. These symptoms were initially attributed to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and Ms. Morgan had been managed accordingly. However, her condition worsened over time, and she developed unexplained weight loss. Upon further evaluation, imaging studies revealed a large, complex abdominal mass that appeared to originate from the ovaries. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, during which extensive tumor involvement was found throughout the abdomen and pelvis. Biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of advanced ovarian cancer, but the unique presentation and delay in diagnosis made it a challenging case. Past Medical History: Ms. Morgan had a history of IBS, which had been the primary focus of her medical care until her recent cancer diagnosis. She had no known drug allergies. Medications: Probiotics for IBS symptoms Social History: Ms. Morgan lives in a rural area outside of Victoria, British Columbia. She is a high school biology teacher and has always been passionate about gardening. She does not smoke and consumes alcohol occasionally. She enjoys outdoor activities like hiking and bird-watching. Assessment: Ms. Morgan is a 45-year-old female with advanced ovarian cancer that presented with atypical gastrointestinal symptoms and a challenging diagnostic journey. The tumor is extensive, involving multiple abdominal and pelvic organs. Her performance status has declined due to the advanced stage of the disease. Plan: Ms. Morgan will undergo comprehensive staging to determine the exact extent of her cancer, including further imaging studies and additional biopsies. A multidisciplinary team, including gynecologic oncologists and medical oncologists, will collaborate on a tailored treatment plan. Treatment options, such as aggressive debulking surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and targeted therapies, will be considered based on the unique presentation and stage of the cancer. Detailed counseling and education will be provided to Ms. Morgan and her family about the complexity of her case, treatment options, potential side effects, and long-term expectations. Palliative care services will be involved early to manage symptoms, provide emotional support, and improve Ms. Morgan's quality of life. Given the rare presentation, this case will be discussed in tumor board meetings to draw insights from various specialties and ensure the best possible care.

He had been experiencing recurring episodes of abdominal pain, flushing, and intermittent diarrhea over the past year. Initially, these symptoms were attributed to gastrointestinal issues, but they worsened in frequency and intensity. Further evaluation revealed elevated levels of serum chromogranin A, and imaging studies demonstrated a small, non-functional PNET in the head of the pancreas. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis, and genetic testing revealed that Mr. Turner had a rare genetic mutation associated with neuroendocrine tumors, adding complexity to his case. Past Medical History: Mr. Turner had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which were well-managed with medications. He had no known drug allergies. Medications: Antihypertensive medication (details provided in medical records) Statin medication for hyperlipidemia Social History: Mr. Turner resides in Vancouver, British Columbia, with his wife.

Assessment: Mr. Turner is a 58-year-old male with a rare and challenging case of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET). The tumor is small but presents with significant symptomatology, including abdominal pain, flushing, and diarrhea. Genetic testing has revealed a unique genetic mutation associated with his condition. Plan: Mr. Turner will undergo further imaging studies, including a somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) scan, to evaluate the extent and activity of the PNET. A multidisciplinary team, consisting of gastroenterologists, endocrinologists, and medical oncologists, will collaborate to develop an individualized treatment plan. Treatment options, such as surgical resection, targeted therapy with somatostatin analogs, and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), will be considered based on the tumor's size, location, and activity. Mr. Turner and his family will receive extensive counseling about his condition, treatment options, potential side effects, and the importance of genetic testing for family members. Close monitoring and follow-up will be essential to manage symptoms, assess treatment response, and address any new developments in this rare case. Given the unique genetic mutation, Mr. Turner's case will be discussed in research forums to contribute to our understanding of PNETs and inform potential future treatments.
